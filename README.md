# CIFAR-10
 
CIFAR-10  is an established computer-vision dataset used for object recognition. It is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6000 images per class. 
This repository contains a TensorFlow-based model for recognizing CIFAR objects. The project includes scripts for preprocessing images, training a deep learning model, and evaluating its performance with various metrics.

## Features
- Image loading and normalization
- Deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Network (with regularization)
- Performance visualization (Loss/Accuracy metrics, ROC curve, Precision-Recall, Confision Matrix)

## Results
- 86,68 % accuracy on test dataset
